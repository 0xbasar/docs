# Welcome to LUKSO Dev docs contributing guide

## Conventions

- We write `true`/`false` (not TRUE, True, **true**...).
- ERC725Y keys MUST always be referenced as: **data keys**, not just keys to not make it confusing for readers if we are talking about keys in general (like controller keys, or public/private keys to control an Externally Owned Account).
- Try to use Markdown as much as possible.
- Bold sentences: we should avoid to write full sentences in bold, so to encourage using bold only for what is important and what we want to emphasize.
- API docs: use present tense + 3rd person singular to describe functions.
  example: `Retrieves an array of data for multiple given keys`.
