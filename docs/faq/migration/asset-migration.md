# Asset Migration

### Will previous Universal Profiles be migrated to mainnet?

LUKSO will migrate all Universal Profiles previously created on the L14 Testnet by [The Dematerialised Marketplace](https://thedematerialised.com/) or [Universal Profile Explorer](https://universalprofile.cloud/). If you deployed custom profiles on older testnets, you would be responsible for migrating them to the mainnet.

### Will previously aquired NFTs be migrated to mainnet?

LUKSO will migrate all previously issued NFTs by the [LUKSO](https://lukso.network/) and [The Dematerialised](https://thedematerialised.com/) brands. If you deployed custom assets and services on older testnets, you would be responsible for migrating them to the mainnet.
