# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is LUKSO?

[LUKSO](https://lukso.network/) is a Blockchain network dedicated to existing and coming digital lifestyle use cases. It will be running with a Casper consensus algorithm (PoS) combined with an [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e) (EVM) execution engine.

## What is LYXe and LYX?

LYX is the native cryptocurrency of the LUKSO Blockchain and is required to secure this decentralized infrastructure. It is used to pay for transaction fees and needs to be locked (staking) to participate in the block production.

"[LYXe](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA8b919680258d369114910511cc87595aec0be6D)" is LYX on the Ethereum Blockchain and is the token that the [Reversible ICO](https://rico.lukso.network) returned.

Once the [LUKSO mainnet](../networks/mainnet/running-a-node.md) starts, there will be a migration of LYXe to LYX on the LUKSO Blockchain. Both LYXe and LYX represent the same asset but on different Blockchain networks.

## Why a new network for LUKSO and why an L1 ?

LUKSO is dedicated to constructing standards that significantly enhance the user experience of blockchain technology, thus facilitating its widespread adoption. To realize this vision, it's essential to establish a fresh network from the ground up. This approach allows early users to experience the ease of use and simplicity brought about by UniversalProfiles and the new standards introduced by LUKSO.

Creating a new network also provides an environment to test and demonstrate the potential of these standards free from the constraints of older standards and tools used on existing networks. It offers a space to evolve and refine these new concepts without hindrance.

As for why LUKSO is a Layer 1 (L1) network, this choice is rooted in the current state of Layer 2 (L2) technologies. While L2 solutions are promising for scaling blockchain systems, they are still heavily under development and their security largely depends on the underlying L1 they are built upon. L1 networks, on the other hand, offer greater security as they are not reliant on another layer. Therefore, to ensure a robust, secure foundation for its innovative standards and user-focused features, LUKSO has opted to build as a Layer 1 network.

## Are transactions on lukso cheaper than other blockchains?

Transactions are usually cheaper on new blockchain networks due to the reduced competition for block space. Essentially, every block on a blockchain has a finite capacity for transactions. If the demand for transactions surpasses this capacity, users must compete for the limited space. This competition often manifests as transaction fees - the higher the fee you're willing to pay, the more likely your transaction will make it into the next block.

On established networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, where the demand for block space is significant, transaction fees can be quite steep. However, on newer networks, fewer users equate to less competition, and hence, lower transaction fees.

Nevertheless, over time, as a network attracts more users and demand for block space rises, transaction fees are likely to increase. It's here where solutions like relay services come into play, which can notably improve this situation. These services can abstract the gas fees from the user, potentially enabling limited free transactions based on their business model.

Furthermore, these relay services can develop a mechanism that allows for the distribution of relay call executions, strategically waiting for times when gas fees are low. This way, relay services can optimize transaction costs while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## Can people use Metamask and other wallets on LUKSO ?

Yes, people can use Metamask and other Ethereum-compatible wallets with LUKSO. This is due to LUKSO being designed as an Ethereum 2.0-like chain, and it maintains compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Metamask, along with many other wallets, were originally created for the Ethereum blockchain and are thus EVM-compatible. This allows them to interact with any blockchain that also supports EVM, which includes LUKSO.

However, while using Metamask and other Ethereum wallets can allow basic interactions with the LUKSO network, it's suggested that for the best and most comprehensive experience on the LUKSO blockchain, you use the UniversalProfile's browser extension. This extension is specifically designed to allow full control of your unique digital identity or 'profile' on the LUKSO network, offering a more integrated and feature-rich experience.

## How can an NFT be updatable on lukso

On the LUKSO network, NFTs can be made updatable through the use of certain standards, specifically the LSP8 standard. While the underlying technology of the LUKSO network is similar to that of Ethereum, it differentiates itself through the use of advanced standards.

The commonly used NFT standards on Ethereum, ERC721 and ERC1155, do not fully support updatable metadata for NFTs. This is a limitation that LUKSO's LSP8 standard seeks to address.

The LSP8 standard introduces a standardized key-value store, which allows for metadata to be stored and updated across time. This makes NFTs on the LUKSO network dynamic, as their information can be altered after they are minted. For more detailed information on how this is achieved, please refer to the [LSP8](../standards/nft-2.0/LSP8-Identifiable-Digital-Asset.md) documentation.

## How can I create a phygital on LUKSO?

Creating a 'phygital' on LUKSO, a hybrid between a physical and a digital asset, involves the use of LUKSO's LSP7 and LSP8 token standards. These standards offer a flexible and updatable data key-value store, enabling a digital asset on the blockchain to carry and update relevant information related to its physical counterpart.

In practice, a phygital asset would have a digital representation on the blockchain using the LSP7 or LSP8 standards. This allows it to link and dynamically update information on-chain that pertains to the physical aspect of the asset.
