# NFT 2.0

:::caution

This section is a work in progress.

:::

NFT2.0 is a collective name for the new token standards [LSP7-DigitalAsset](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-7-DigitalAsset.md) and [LSP8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset.md), those replace ERC20 and ERC721, which you would usually use on Ethereum. We have [LSP7 and LSP8 implementations that are backwards compatible to ERC20 and ERC721](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-universalprofile-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts), but we highly recommend using the native ones.
