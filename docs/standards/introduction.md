# The LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs)

LUKSO comes with a set of new standards for smart contracts that should be used as the core pieces of your dApp.

The main new standards are based around [Universal Profiles](Universal-Profiles.md) and [NFT2.0](NFT2.0.md).

To see Universal Profiles (ðŸ†™) live on the [L14 testnet](../networks/l14-testnet.md) check out the [universalprofile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud/) lets you easily browse the deployed profiles.
