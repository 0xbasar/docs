# The LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs)

> LSPs are like lego bricks. They are individual and unique pieces on their own.
>
> Combined together, they enable to build of unique pieces such as Universal Profile, or a new generation of NFTs.

LUKSO comes with a set of new standards for smart contracts and Dapp development. These new standards are based around [Universal Profiles](Universal-Profiles.md) and [NFT2.0](./NFT2.0.md).

In this docs, we will give an overview of what each LSP does and how to start using them together.

We will start with a Universal Profile as our _main lego block_, and **"plug new lego pieces"** **(= add new LSPs)** to enhance it.

**Foundational LSPs**

| LSP  | Title               | Description                                     |
| :--- | :------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| LSP0 | ERC725 Account      | a blockchain account (based on ERC725 standard) |
| LSP2 | ERC725Y JSON Schema | a schema to describe a set of key-value pairs   |

**Universal Profiles LSPs**

| LSP  | Title              | Description                                                                              |
