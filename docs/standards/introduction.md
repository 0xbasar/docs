# The LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs)

## Introduction

The current **blockchain experience** comes with a lot of limitation. Not necessarily because of the complexity but because of the broken infrastructure represented by the old underlying tools and standards that are being used to operate on the network.

In order to create a better user experience on the blockchain, change should start from the bottom, the very basic pieces then propogate to the top. 
Topics related to **identity**, **assets representation** and **smart contract interaction** should be standardized. They should be done in a flexible way that supports more potential use-cases in the future.

The following documentation describes the fundamentals of the standards and technical aspects of the ecosystem. Please join the [#standards](https://discord.com/channels/359064931246538762/620552532602912769) channel in LUKSO Discord server. Our team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand the standards.



## What do these standards represent ?

They represent the **main building blocks** that could be used by people, groups and organizations to build blockchain-based applications along with the ability to maximize the user experience, allow more flexibility and interaction and open doors to hundreds of ideas that could be built on top.

These standards are translated into smart contracts code provided by **LUKSO**, they represent the **default implementation** knowing that in the future people could derive from these contracts and implement their custom logic.

The smart contract implementation of these standards is described in the [Contracts Implementation](./smart-contracts/01-introduction.md) section.
## LSPs Foundation

This section lists and shortly describes the first ten standards that represent the foundation of **LUKSO's ecosystem**, including new topics introduced like **blockchain-based accounts** also-know-as **UniversalProfiles**, **Digital Assets and NFT 2.0**. 

:::note
The standards are **order-independant**, they could be related with a **backward/forward** order.
