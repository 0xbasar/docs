# Connect to a Universal Profile


To allow your users to connect to your dApp and to have the benefits of Universal Profiles, they need to ✨ [create a profile](https://my.universalprofile.cloud) smart contract and install the 🖥️ [Universal Profile Browser Extension](#)

The easiest for your users to create a Universal Profile, is through 👉 [my.universalprofile.cloud](https://my.universalprofile.cloud).

:::note
Optionally you [can deploy a profile smart contract for your users](../../guides/universal-profile/create-profile.md), but then they will not reveive the ability to make free transactions through our Transaction Relay Service.
